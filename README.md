PROBLEM
Plastic is incredibly useful in modern life, but its widespread use may impair human sustainability. The production and disposal of plastic generates greenhouse gases and hazardous waste. Plastic and the chemicals it emits are building up on land and in oceans, lakes, rivers, ice, and air, and the resulting damage to human and ecological health is currently poorly understood. Further, plastic products often break down into very small fragments called microplastics that can pollute ecosystems and harm organisms.

•Plastico is a platform where the ordinary “mwananchi” can request for their plastic waste to be collected.  

The platform aims to enhance the process of value addition to plastic waste by recycling companies and SMEs.

Furthermore, the solution will incentivize ordinary Kenyans to earn from their waste

Plastico attempts to change human perspective towards plastic waste by enabling them to find value in said waste.
